---

## 📋 Core Features

-   **Hybrid Retrieval Pipeline**: Combines the strengths of keyword-based search (BM25) and semantic vector search (FAISS) using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to retrieve the most relevant document chunks.
-   **Cross-Encoder Reranking**: Employs a `cross-encoder` model to re-rank the initial retrieved results for maximum precision before passing them to the generator.
-   **Multi-LLM Generation Strategy**: Ensures high availability and cost-effectiveness by using a fallback chain: **Google Gemini** -> **OpenAI GPT** -> **OpenRouter (Free Models)**.
-   **Source Citations**: The generated answer includes inline citations `[Source: file_name.pdf, Page: X]` to link back to the source documents, ensuring verifiability.
-   **Deployment Ready**: Comes with a `Dockerfile` for easy containerization and deployment on cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
-   **Modular & Scalable Architecture**: The `src` directory is organized by function (loaders, preprocessing, retrieval, generation), making the system easy to maintain and extend.

## 🏗️ System Architecture & Data Flow

The pipeline processes a user's query in several stages to generate a cited, accurate answer.

```
User Query ───────────────> [Query Preprocessing] ──────────────────> [Hybrid Retrieval] ──────────> [Reranking] ──> [Context Formatting] ──> [LLM Generation] ──> Final Answer
                             (Normalization)      |                     (BM25 + FAISS)                  (Cross-Encoder)      (Add Sources)         (Gemini/OpenAI)
                                                  |
                                                  └─> [Semantic Cache Check] ─(Cache Hit)─> Returns Cached Answer
```

1.  **Query Preprocessing**: The user's query is cleaned and normalized.
2.  **Semantic Cache**: The system first checks if an answer for an identical query already exists in the cache to provide a near-instantaneous response.
3.  **Hybrid Retrieval**:
    *   **Dense Retrieval**: The query is encoded into a vector using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, which then searches a `FAISS` index for semantically similar document chunks.
    *   **Sparse Retrieval**: A `BM25` index is used to find chunks containing relevant keywords.
    *   **Fusion**: The results from both retrievers are combined using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to produce a single, relevance-ranked list.
4.  **Reranking**: A more powerful `cross-encoder` model re-evaluates the top results from the fusion step to improve precision.
5.  **Generation**: The top-ranked, reranked document chunks are formatted into a context block and passed to an LLM (starting with Gemini) to generate a final, coherent answer with citations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.10+
-   An environment variable manager (e.g., `python-dotenv`)
-   API keys for Google Gemini and/or OpenAI.

### 1. Setup and Installation

Clone the repository and set up the environment.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gauthambinoy/RAG-.git
cd RAG-

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up your API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Now, edit the .env file and add your API keys
nano .env
```

### 2. Build the Knowledge Base Index

Before running the application, you need to process your source documents and build the retrieval indices. Place your PDF, DOCX, and Excel files in the `data/documents/`, `data/pdfs/`, and `data/tables/` directories respectively.

```bash
# Run the index-building script
# This creates the BM25 and FAISS indices and saves them to the `outputs` directory.
python scripts/build_index.py
```

### 3. Run the Application

You can interact with the RAG system via a Streamlit web interface or a FastAPI backend.

**Option A: Run the Streamlit Dashboard**

```bash
streamlit run app/dashboard.py
```

**Option B: Run the FastAPI Server**

```bash
uvicorn app.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

---

## 🐳 Docker & Deployment

The application is containerized for easy and repeatable deployments.

### Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t rag-system .
```

### Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  --env-file .env \
  -v $(pwd)/outputs:/app/outputs \
  rag-system
```

This command runs the FastAPI server. The `-v` flag mounts the `outputs` directory containing your indices into the container.

## 🔬 Findings & Design Trade-offs

This section details the key design decisions and their rationale.

### 1. Retrieval Strategy: Hybrid Search (BM25 + FAISS)

-   **Decision**: Instead of relying on a single retrieval method, I implemented a hybrid approach that combines keyword-based (BM25) and semantic (FAISS) search.
-   **Findings**:
    *   **BM25** excels at finding documents with specific keywords, acronyms, or jargon (e.g., "GPT-3").
    *   **Vector Search (FAISS)** is better at finding conceptually related content, even if the exact keywords are not present (e.g., query "dangers of AI" matching text about "AI safety risks").
    *   Combining them via **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** provided a significant boost in retrieval relevance over either method alone.
-   **Trade-off**: The hybrid approach adds complexity to the codebase and increases retrieval latency slightly. However, the dramatic improvement in accuracy was deemed a worthwhile trade-off for a high-quality Q&A system.

### 2. Reranking: Cross-Encoder for Precision

-   **Decision**: After the initial hybrid retrieval, a `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` model is used to re-rank the top ~20 results.
-   **Findings**: The initial retrieval is fast but can sometimes place less relevant chunks in the top 3-5 positions. The cross-encoder, while slower, is far more accurate at determining the final relevance of a chunk to the query. This step was crucial for reducing noise and ensuring the context passed to the LLM was of the highest possible quality.
-   **Trade-off**: Reranking is the most computationally expensive part of the retrieval pipeline. This adds latency to the overall response time. For applications requiring near-instantaneous answers, this step could be made optional or removed, at the cost of potentially lower-quality answers.

### 3. Embedding Model: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`

-   **Decision**: I chose a small, high-performance model that can run locally without requiring an API call.
-   **Findings**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` provides a fantastic balance of speed and performance. It's fast enough for real-time applications and powerful enough to capture the semantic meaning of the text effectively.
-   **Trade-off**: While excellent, this model is not as powerful as larger, state-of-the-art embedding models available via APIs (like OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large`). Using a larger model could yield better retrieval results for highly nuanced queries but would increase operational costs and introduce network latency.

### 4. Generation: Multi-Provider LLM Fallback Chain

-   **Decision**: The system does not rely on a single LLM provider. It uses a fallback chain (Gemini -> OpenAI -> OpenRouter).
-   **Findings**: API services can experience downtime or rate limiting. This strategy makes the system more resilient. If the primary provider (Gemini) fails, it automatically switches to the secondary (OpenAI), and so on. It also offers a path to cost optimization by prioritizing cheaper or free models.
-   **Trade-off**: This adds complexity to the configuration (requiring multiple API keys) and the generation logic. However, for any production-grade system, this level of robustness is essential.
- **Index size:** 206 vectors (~309 KB FAISS + ~50 KB BM25)
- **Index build time:** ~35 seconds (first run), <1s (cached)
- **Query time:** ~100-150ms per query (including reranking)
- **Search method:** Exact L2 distance (FAISS IndexFlatL2) + BM25 scoring

### **Generation Performance**
- **LLM:** Gemini 2.5-flash (primary), GPT-4o-mini (fallback)
- **Average tokens/query:** ~800-1200 tokens (context + answer)
- **Response time:** ~1.5-2.5 seconds end-to-end
- **Cost per query:** ~$0.0001-0.0003 (Gemini Flash), ~$0.0005-0.001 (OpenAI)
- **Provider success rate:** Gemini 95%, OpenAI 5% (fallback)

## 🎯 Technical Decisions & Trade-offs

### **1. Data Preparation**

#### **Chunking Strategy**
- **Choice:** 800 characters with 100-character overlap
- **Rationale:**
  - 800 chars ≈ 200 tokens (fits embedding model context)
  - 100-char overlap preserves sentence continuity
  - Balances granularity vs context
- **Alternatives:**
  - Smaller (400 chars): More precise, but loses context
  - Larger (1500 chars): More context, but less precise retrieval
  - Semantic chunking: Better quality, but much slower

#### **Normalization**
- **Choices:** Lowercase, Unicode NFKD, whitespace collapse
- **Rationale:**
  - Improves embedding consistency
  - Reduces vocabulary size
  - Handles accents/special chars
- **Trade-off:** Loses some formatting (acceptable for Q&A)
